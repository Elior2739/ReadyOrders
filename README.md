# Ready Orders

A mod for [Fast Food Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2916430/Fast_Food_Simulator/) using [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS)

## Mod's Goal

When playing with groups & ingame AI it's sometimes confusing the players/cookers if the order is already made
So this mod shows on screen if the order is ready.
